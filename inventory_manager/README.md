# CatalogIT

A [Processing](https://processing.org/) application for managing hardware inventory.
This project is a demo on, how the language - which is intended for visual programming - can actually handle input and data modifications.

### Requirements
You need too have the Processing IDE installed (get it from [here](https://processing.org/download/)). Open `application.pde` in the Processing, and use the tool to build the executeable package.
